- When dealing with Jira tickets, always use the Jira project "REF"

## Deployment Report Template

When asked to generate a deployment report for any time period, use this template:

### Standard Deployment Report Structure:

1. **Find all deployment tickets** for the specified time period in the REF project
   - Search: `project = REF AND created >= "[START_DATE]" AND created <= "[END_DATE]" AND (issuetype = "Deployment" OR summary ~ "deployment" OR description ~ "deployment" OR labels = "deployment")`
   - Fields: `key,summary,issuetype,status,created,assignee,fixVersions,labels,description`

2. **List linked child issues** for each deployment ticket
   - Get child/referenced tickets (exclude parent epics)
   - For tickets mentioned in deployment title (e.g., "REF-2228/REF-2351"), retrieve those ticket details
   - Include: ticket key, summary, status for each linked issue

3. **Group deployments by Fixed Version**
   - Use the `fixVersions` field to group tickets
   - Format: Show version name as group header with all tickets listed underneath
   - Handle empty versions: Group under "No Fixed Version Set"

4. **Include these details for each ticket**:
   - Ticket key with Jira link
   - Summary/title
   - Creation date
   - Status with indicator (âœ… for Done/Deployed)
   - Assignee name
   - Referenced child tickets (if any)

5. **Provide summary section**:
   - Total count of deployment tickets
   - Status breakdown
   - Fixed version distribution

### Usage Instructions:
- Replace `[START_DATE]` and `[END_DATE]` with actual dates (format: "YYYY-MM-DD")
- For monthly reports: Use first and last day of the month
- Always retrieve complete ticket details using `*all` fields when needed for comprehensive information
- Use parallel tool calls to efficiently gather all ticket information

### Example Request Formats:
- "Generate deployment report for June 2025"
- "Show deployment tickets for Q1 2025"
- "List deployments from January 1 to January 15, 2025"
