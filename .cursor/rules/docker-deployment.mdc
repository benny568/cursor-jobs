# Docker Deployment Rules

## Container Requirements

1. **The frontend is to be run in a docker container.**

   - The frontend application must be containerized using Docker
   - Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` configuration for local development
   - The frontend service should be accessible via the configured port mapping

2. **The backend is to be run in a docker container.**
   - The backend application must be containerized using Docker
   - Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` configuration for local development
   - The backend service should connect to other services (database, Jira proxy) within the Docker network

## Implementation Notes

- Both frontend and backend containers are defined in `docker-compose.yml`
- Use `docker compose up` to start all services together
- For production deployments, use `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Ensure proper environment variable configuration for container communication

## Commands

- **Development**: `docker compose up`
- **Production**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`
- **Rebuild**: `docker compose build --no-cache`
