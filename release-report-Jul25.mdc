## üìã DEPLOYMENT TICKETS ANALYSIS

Deployment tickets that reference our target release tickets:

| Deployment Ticket                                         | Summary                   | Status   | Referenced Release Tickets   | Date       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| [REF-2942](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/browse/REF-2942) | 07/07/2025-CMS-Deployment | Deployed | REF-2782, REF-2769, REF-2497 | 2025-07-07 |

## üìä Summary Analysis

### Deployment Status Breakdown:

- **‚úÖ Deployed**: 4 tickets (33%) - All have "Done" or "Deployed" status
- **‚ùå Not Deployed**: 8 tickets (67%)

### Readiness Status for Undeployed Tickets:

- **‚úÖ Ready for Production**: 1 ticket (REF-2731) - Ready to be deployed
- **‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress**: 7 tickets - Still in development phases

### Key Insights:

1. **Status-Based Deployment**: With the updated interpretation, all "Done" status tickets are considered deployed
2. **Deployment Link Confirmation**: The three "Done" tickets (REF-2782, REF-2769, REF-2497) are also explicitly linked to the deployment ticket REF-2942, confirming their deployment
3. **Next Deployment Candidate**: REF-2731 is the only ticket with "Ready for Production" status, making it the primary candidate for the next deployment
4. **Development Pipeline**: 7 tickets are still in various stages of development and not yet ready for deployment

### Recommendations:

1. **Deploy Ready Ticket**: REF-2731 can be deployed immediately as it has "Ready for Production" status
2. **Monitor Development Progress**: Track the remaining 7 tickets through their development pipeline
3. **Deployment Coverage**: The 33% deployment rate reflects tickets that have completed development and been deployed

## üìà Status Definitions

**CRITICAL**: Understanding ticket statuses for deployment readiness:

- **"Ready"** = Ready for development (NOT ready for deployment)
- **"Ready for Production"** = Ready for deployment
- **"Done"** = Already deployed
- **"Deployed"** = Already deployed to production
- **"In Development", "In Code Review", "Ready for Testing"** = Still in progress (not ready for deployment)

---

## Conclusion

The deployment linkage report shows that the "Weaver - Jul25" release has achieved a 33% deployment rate with 4 out of 12 tickets successfully deployed. The updated status interpretation provides clearer deployment tracking by treating "Done" status as a deployment indicator, which aligns with the development workflow where tickets are marked "Done" after successful deployment.

**Next Actions:**

- Deploy REF-2731 (Ready for Production)
- Continue development on remaining 7 tickets
- Monitor progress towards next deployment milestone

_This report was generated using the updated deployment linkage methodology that considers "Done" status as already deployed._
